//Program Name : FileRW.java   Solution File for Files Activity 2
//Example of Reading and Writing from a file
//Author : P Baker
//Date : 
//Brief Description:  We will use this starting file to show an example
//   of reading and writing to stream files.
//
//Using Eclipse note:  Create a Java package under src.  All files must be
//    inside the same Java package.  In my example
//    I created a package called ch10Files.  So the path 
//    for all files will be src/ch10Files/~~~~

import java.io.*; //needed for FileReader and PrintWriter
import java.util.Scanner;

		Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader("src/ch10Files/StudentGrades.txt"));
		//declare and instantiate the output file object and open the file
		PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter("src/ch10Files/GradeReport.txt");

		
		String line; //variable to put each line as read
		
		//write the nice title lines to the output file
		outFile.println("Java Class Grade Report");
		outFile.println("-----------------------");

		/*use while because don't know how many lines in the file
		  hasNextLine returns false when the end of the file is reached. */

				outFile.println(line);  //write each line to the output file
